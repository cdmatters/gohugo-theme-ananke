Monty is a repository of bots that work with the smithers poker bot engine. Currently these bots are quite naive, but the aim is to investigate multi-agent RL in this scenario. 

You can watch a very naive game between bots (prerecorded and slowed down to human-viewing speed) [here](/pdfs/smithers/).
