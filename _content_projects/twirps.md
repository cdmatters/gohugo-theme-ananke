Twirps is a project to collect, analyse and visualise politician's tweets. A preliminary version was built in the run up to the 2015 UK General Election, and it was later turned into a Flask web app in 2017, using a graph Neo4j database as it's datastore.

## Write Up Coming Soon

### The Project

In the run up to the 2015 UK General Election, political twitter had really started to heat up. We had the we'd had 5 years of coalition government between parties led by two relatively young leaders, and it looked likely the next government would also be a coalition. This was, supposedly, a time before the fragmentation of parties, where people 'reached out' of their echo chamber.

### The Aim

### The Stack

* python2.7
* Flask (webapp)
* Neo4j (backend)
* d3.js (visualisation)
