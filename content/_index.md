I am a senior research engineer at [Meta AI](https://ai.facebook.com/), where my research intersects probabilistic modelling, reinforcement learning and natural language processing.


Currently my work focuses on agentic behaviour in large language models. 

For more on my work, see my [GitHub](https://github.com/condnsdmatters/), [Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ehquBPIAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) page, or see [here](./vitae/)
