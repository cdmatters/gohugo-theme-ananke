I am a senior research engineer at [Meta AI](https://ai.facebook.com/), where my research intersects probabilistic modelling, reinforcement learning and natural language processing.


Currently my work focuses on agentic behaviour in large language models. 

For more on my work, see my GitHub, CV or Scholar page.
