For my Master's thesis at UCL, I investigated how the latest NLP techniques could be applied to written source code, to generate English description of source code arguments. The submitted thesis can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/condnsdmatters/ucl-thesis/blob/master/Thesis.pdf) and source code is available below. It got the second highest mark in the year.
