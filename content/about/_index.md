I am a machine learning engineer and software developer, with research interest in natural language processing, probabilistic modelling, reinforcement learning.

I have experience in writing large-scale financial software in C/C++ and Python, and consulting on  machine learning projects, and conducting machine learning research. 

I hold a BA and MSci in Physics from the University of Cambridge, and a MSc in Machine Learning from UCL, in which I got the top distinction in the year. 

At UCL, I wrote my thesis with Prof. Sebastian Riedel and Matko Bo≈°njak, on the automatic documentation of programming languages.
