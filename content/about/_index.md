I am a member of technical staff at [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/).

Before that I was a researcher & engineer at [Meta AI](https://ai.facebook.com/), where I worked on large language models, agentic behaviour and long horizon tasks. 

I’ve had a pretty broad experience in ML, ranging from language modelling code[¹](https://github.com/cdmatters/ucl-thesis/blob/master/Thesis.pdf) before it was cool, to working on deep Gaussian Processes[²](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.05674v1), to deep Reinforcement Learning for procedurally-generated environments[³](https://github.com/facebookresearch/nle/), and (most recently) back to large language models[⁴](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13971).


This ride has taken me some fun places on the software engineering side, including writing performant data loaders for internet-scale datasets[⁵](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00539), fiddling with very ancient C codebases[⁶](https://github.com/facebookresearch/nle/), writing distributed fail-over systems for large language model training, and writing parallelisation code for custom operations in Tensorflow.

Before my career as a research engineer, I had experience in writing large-scale financial software[⁷](https://www.bloomberg.com/terminal) in C/C++ and Python, and consulted on machine learning projects[⁸](https://cantwait.ideo.com/).

I hold a BA and MSci in Physics (Natural Sciences) from the University of Cambridge, and an MSc in Machine Learning from UCL. In this latter course, I graduated top of my class, writing my thesis with [Prof. Sebastian Riedel](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AcCtcrsAAAAJ) and [Dr. Matko Bošnjak](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=JDaHecMAAAAJ) and taking courses at the Gatsby Institute.
