I am a machine learning engineer and software developer, with a research focus in probabilistic modelling, reinforcement learning and natural language processing.

I have experience in writing large-scale financial software in C/C++ and Python, consulting on machine learning projects, and conducting machine learning research in industry and academia. 

I hold a BA and MSci in Physics from the University of Cambridge, and an MSc in Machine Learning from UCL, where I wrote my thesis with Prof. Sebastian Riedel and Dr. Matko Bo≈°njak and took courses at the Gatsby Institute.

I currently work at [Facebook AI Research](https://ai.facebook.com/) as a research engineer, in their "blue-sky" laboratory.
