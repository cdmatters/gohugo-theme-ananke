I am a senior research engineer at [Meta AI](https://ai.facebook.com/), where my research intersects probabilistic modelling, reinforcement learning and natural language processing.

I've had a pretty broad experience in ML, ranging from language modelling code before it was cool, to working on deep Gaussian Process libraries, to deep Reinforcement Learning for procedurally-generated environments, and (most recently) back to Large Language Models.

This ride has taken me some fun places on the software engineering side, including writing performant data loaders for internet-scale datasets, fiddling with very ancient C codebases, writing distributed fail-over systems for large language model training, and writing parallelisation code for custom operations in Tensorflow.

Before my career as a research engineer, I had experience in writing large-scale financial software in C/C++ and Python, and consulted on machine learning projects.

I hold a BA and MSci in Physics from the University of Cambridge, and an MSc in Machine Learning from UCL, where I wrote my thesis with Prof. Sebastian Riedel and Dr. Matko Bo≈°njak and took courses at the Gatsby Institute.
